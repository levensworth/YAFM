# Simple Download organizer
If you have a mac, your Donwloads folder is a mess.
This script comes to save you.

## How it works?:
1. You change the `TYPED_FOLDERS = [...]` by adding any new subfolder you want, they must be `{'sub_folder': 'your subfolder name', 'types': ['types this sub folder should accept']}`.
2. `SOURCE_FOLDER_PATH = ...` should point to the full path to the folder where changes may occur.
3. `DESTINATION_FOLDER= ...` should point to the full path of the root folder where the (now clssified) files will be.
4. `run python file-manager.py &` this will keep the program running and watching the folder, for further changes
