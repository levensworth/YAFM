# Simple Download organizer
If you have a mac, your Donwloads folder is a mess.
This script comes to save you.

## How it works?:
1. You change the `TYPED_FOLDERS = [...]` by adding any new subfolder you want, they must be `{'sub_folder': 'your subfolder name', 'types': ['types this sub folder should accept']}`.
2. `SOURCE_FOLDER_PATH = ...` should point to the full path to the folder where changes may occur.
3. `DESTINATION_FOLDER= ...` should point to the full path of the root folder where the (now clssified) files will be.
4. Run `chmod u+x run.sh` this just allow your shell to execute the file `run.sh`
5. Run `./run.sh` this will create a virtualenv and download the necessary requirements, after that start watching for your folder.
